<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a rock climber, translator and, maybe someday, senior programmer. Originally from Colombia, I love discovering new cultures, especially their food.</p>

<p>My work experience has mostly been freelance, taking any and almost always all translating work that has come my way. </p>

<p>I got into programming in July 2023 for two reasons: for a challenge, since translating had put my brain into sort of an auto-pilot mode; and to endeavor towards a higher-paying, not-so-stale career - the sort of career that is soon going to make translators unemployed.</p>
